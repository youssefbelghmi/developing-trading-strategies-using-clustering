Instructions to Run the Project Correctly

To execute this project optimally, please follow the steps below:

1. Organizing Files:
- Place all notebooks and data in a single folder. This ensures that the scripts can access the files without any path issues.

2. Available Data:
The project can be run in demo mode or full analysis mode, depending on the value of the 'full_analysis' variable defined in the main notebook file:

- Demo Mode (full_analysis = False) :  
  The data used in this case is located in a folder named S&P500_demo. This folder must be extracted from a ZIP file provided in the Moodle submission. Ensure that you unzip the file before using it.
  
- Full Analysis Mode (full_analysis = True) : 
  The complete data is available in a ZIP file downloadable via WeTransfer at the following link: [https://we.tl/t-yJg4LIk2gq](https://we.tl/t-yJg4LIk2gq). This data is only available for 7 days starting Sunday, January 26th, 8 PM due to free account limitations on WeTransfer. Make sure to download and extract this data before it becomes unavailable.

3. Configuration and Execution:
A. Ensure the following folders are correctly placed in the same directory as the notebooks:
   - S&P500_demo for demo mode.
   - S&P500 for full analysis mode.
B. Open the main notebook file.
C. Modify the full_analysis variable:
   - Set it to False to use demo mode (S&P500_demo).
   - Set it to True to use full analysis mode (S&P500).
D. Run the main  file.
   - This script will automatically run the entire project and print the results of the strategies we have implemented.

By following these steps, the project will be set up and ready to run without any issues.
