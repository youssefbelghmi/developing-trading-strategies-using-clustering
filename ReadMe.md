# Development of Trading Strategies Leveraging Clustering

## Project Description

This project aims to develop trading strategies by applying clustering techniques to group intraday trading periods based on factors such as volatility, volume, and spread. By identifying patterns, it enables the creation of strategies suited to different market conditions. The process involves data preparation, clustering analysis, and backtesting to assess performance and reliability. This approach enhances decision-making and optimizes trading results in dynamic financial markets.

## Data Sources

This study uses minute-level intraday stock data from companies listed in the S&P 500 during 2010, providing a detailed view of short-term market dynamics. The S&P 500, which tracks 500 major U.S. companies across sectors like technology, healthcare, and finance, offers broad economic representation, making it ideal for market analysis. The dataset is unfortunately not available directly in this repository due to memory constraints.
